# 📖 Bible Verse Mood Classifier

A simple **Machine Learning + Streamlit** application that recommends encouraging **Bible verses** based on how a user feels.  
You type a short sentence expressing your mood (e.g., *“I’m anxious about tomorrow”*), and the app predicts the emotion and returns a relevant Bible verse.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects emotion (joy, fear, sadness, peace, hope) from user input.  
- Displays a random Bible verse related to that emotion.  
- Simple, interactive **web interface** built with **Streamlit**.  
- Lightweight — runs locally without internet connection.  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **Streamlit** – frontend for the web app  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning model  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling  
- *(Optional later)* Transformers & Torch for advanced NLP

## 🪶 Future Improvements
- Integrate a **transformer-based model** (DistilBERT or RoBERTa) for better emotion detection.  
- Add **more emotions** and **verses**.  
- Polish the **UI** with backgrounds and icons.  
- Allow users to **save or share** their favorite verses.
